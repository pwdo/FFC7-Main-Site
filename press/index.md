# Form Function & Class 7 brings in top talents in web design this October

Form Function & Class, the pioneering web design conference in Asia, returns for the 7th time this October 22–23, 2016 in the Philippines along with a Masterclass on front-end performance & optimization.

The Form Function & Class 7 web design conference is a grassroots event organized by the Philippine Web Designers Organization that equips designers and developers with the latest ideas, tools, and techniques to better their craft & advance their career.

Stylistically called \<form\> function() & .class, the name of the conference alludes to the 3 main elements of a website (\<form\> from HTML, function() from JavaScript, .class from CSS) as well as the 3 concepts central to the craft (form, function, and continuous learning). Besides HTML, CSS, and JS, the conference tackles branding, mobile, interface design, user experience, business, and other relevant topics in creating sites, apps, and other digital products.

FFC7 is open to all web designers, front-end designers & developers, user interface designers, interaction designers, mobile app designers, user experience designers, graphic designers, web developers, webmasters, bloggers, search engine and digital marketers, social media managers, as well as professionals / hobbyists / students in information technology, visual communication, multimedia arts, human computer interaction. If you work on web and mobile interfaces, this event is a great learning opportunity for you.

Form Function & Class takes place at the Hive Hotel in Quezon City. The first day consists of plenary talks and panels from top talents in the Philippines and Asia, including:

- Deane Miguel — founder of Serious Studio  
- Kendra Schaefer — front-end designer, art director, writer from Beijing  
- Sam Chan — independent UX designer and lecturer at Ateneo de Manila University  
- Mika Aldaba — nomadic data designer at Thinking Machines  
- Chris Lienert — senior web developer consultant and Singapore CSS founder
