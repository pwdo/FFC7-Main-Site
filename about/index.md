# About the Conference

\<form\> function() & .class is a web design conference created by volunteers and dedicated to the local community in Asia, held in the sunny/rainy shores of the Philippines.

The name FFC alludes to the 3 elements of a website (\<form\> from HTML, function() from JavaScript, .class from CSS) and the 3 concepts central to the craft (form, function, and continuous learning).

As the pioneering web design conference in the country and this side of the world, we have drawn crowds of over 300 professionals & students each year from the fields of design, development, IT, marketing, user experience, interaction design, mobile, business, and more.
