# About Form Function & Class

\<form\> function() & .class is a web design conference created by volunteer web designers and dedicated to the local community in Asia, held in the sunny/rainy shores of the Philippines.

The name FFC alludes to the 3 elements of a website (HTML, CSS, JS) and the 3 concepts central to the craft (form, function, and continuous learning).

As the pioneering web design conference in the country and this side of the world, we have drawn crowds of over 300 professionals & students each year from the fields of design, development, IT, marketing, user experience, interaction design, mobile, business, and more.

This year we crumple our miserable sketches and raise our molotovs to wage war against evil design. Weâ€™re flying in the sharpest minds in design & development, armed with the best strategies to take down the enemy. Be part of the design revolution this November 14.
